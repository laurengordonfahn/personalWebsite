## Getting Started:

## Prerequisites:

# Prerequisites General Information:
Personal Website is a static node.js React application.
This means that you will need node/create-react-app dependencies. 
Node and React's dependencies are found in package.json. You will need either node's npm or yarn installer to successfully download the libraries noted in packages.json.

# Prerequisites Steps:
1) Download the project in a directory of its own. Navigate into the new directory and type in the following command.  
```
    $ git clone git@github.com:laurengordonfahn/personalWebsite.git
```

2) Download package.json dependencies using yarn OR npm. The following command will source all dependencies in package.json. If you are not certain if you have yarn visit https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.  Yarn will create yarn.lock which will show you all sub-dependencies utilized. Yarn also offers 'yarn upgrade' a command that will help you keep dependency libraries up-to-date. 
```
    $ yarn install
```
If using npm :
```
    $npm install
```
3) For your information these are the project requirements found in the package.json file
